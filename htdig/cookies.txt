# here is what each field represents:

# domain	The domain that created AND that can read the variable.
# flag		A TRUE/FALSE value indicating if all machines within a given
#		domain can access the variable. This value is IGNORED.

# secure	A TRUE/FALSE value indicating if a secure connection with the
#		domain is needed to access the variable. IGNORED.
# expiration	The UNIX time that the variable will expire on. UNIX time is
#		defined as the number of seconds since epoc (Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 GMT).
#		If you want to issue a session cookie, just set this field
#		value to '0'.
# name		The name of the variable.
# value		The value of the variable.
#
# For instance, a cookies.txt file may have an entry that looks like this:
